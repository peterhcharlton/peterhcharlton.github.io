It is important that the wearables are able to capture data in everyday life when unmonitored (unsupervised by the researchers - left to their own devices).\nThis post describes initial testing of candidate devices for the study.\nDevices The devices under test, shown at the top of this page, were:\n Reference ECG chest-patch: The Bittium Faros 180 was used with long-term electrodes. It was worn on the sternum, with one electrode placed at the top of the sternum, and the other placed towards the bottom of the sternum (the green, F/LL electrode was not attached). It was set to record a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal at 125 Hz, with no additional recording (such as accelerometry) or analysis (such as RR-interval derivation). Data were stored on the device for retrospective download via USB. Photoplethysmography-based wristband: The Max-Health-Band was used to record photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometry (accel) signals at the wrist. PPG signals were sampled at 25 Hz (green and ambient), and tri-axis accel signals were also sampled at 25 Hz. The data are initially stored on the device, and transmitted via Bluetooth to a mobile phone for long-term storage (due to limited on-device memory). Electrocardiography-based wristband: The Withings Move ECG device was used to acquire 30-second ECG recordings on demand (when the user activated the ECG recording). Mobile phone: A \u0026lsquo;Motorola Moto G8 Power Lite\u0026rsquo; Android mobile phone was used to store signals from the two wristbands. Macrodroid was used to open and close two apps in turn to download signals from the PPG and ECG wristbands (the \u0026lsquo;PulseOn Demo\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Withings Health Mate\u0026rsquo; apps respectively). The PPG app was opened twice per hour, for 14 minutes each time, and the ECG app was opened once per hour, for 14 minutes.  Protocol A single user attempted to wear the devices for seven days.\n Reference ECG chest-patch: The user changed electrodes if necessary (due to discomfort), but otherwise the device was unattended. The user shaved prior to application, and removed the device for showering. Photoplethysmography-based wristband: This device was removed and charged each day (typically for 1-2 hours, until it indicated it was fully charged). It was also removed when showering and washing. The device appeared to freeze at one point, so was reset. Otherwise, it was unattended. Electrocardiography-based wristband: ECG recordings were acquired each day (somewhat sporadically). Mobile phone: The mobile phone was kept on charge in a room where the user spent several hours each day.  Outcomes User acceptability The devices were worn for approximately 6.5 days. They were removed early because the ECG chest-patch was sounding a low battery alarm. The user changed one of the chest-patch electrodes twice during the study, and the other one was not changed at all.\nData acquisition Signal samples: Samples of ECG chest-patch and PPG wristband signals are shown below. These samples were recorded at night, explaining the low heart rate and relatively high signal quality. The PPG signals did not appear to degrade over time. The ECG signals on days 1-3 clearly show P waves, QRS complexes, and T-waves. Several of the PPG signals show two peaks (a systolic and a diastolic peak). This plot demonstrates that it is possible to obtain high quality signals using these devices. However, the ECG signals did appear to be of lower quality from day 5 onwards. Possible explanations for this include: (i) the electrode contact degraded over time (particularly as one of the electrodes was not replaced over the course of the 7 days); and (ii) there was mains interference (such as on Day 6).\n  Signal samples over the 7 days of testing: (left) the reference ECG chest patch; (right) the PPG wristband.  Inter-beat intervals: Minute-long samples of ECG chest-patch and PPG wristband signals are shown below, as well as inter-beat intervals derived from the signals. The close agreement between inter-beat intervals derived from the two signals shows that it is possible to obtain reliable inter-beat intervals from these devices.\n  Signals and inter-beat intervals: obtained from (i) the PPG wristband; (ii) the reference ECG chest patch.  ECG data quality Upon further inspection, it became clear that the ECG was of high quality until approximately 4 days (94 hours) into the recording. After then, the ECG was mostly of low quality. The change from high to low quality is shown in the figure below.\n  ECG signals throughout the testing: Short 2-second samples of ECG signals obtained through the 6.5 days of testing. Defintion: Hr - hour    ECG signals during the second half of testing Short 2-second samples of ECG signals in the second half of testing. Most samples before 96 hours were of high quality, whereas most after this time point were of low quality. Defintion: Hr - hour  Learning points We learnt several things from the testing:\n Low battery alarm: The ECG chest-patch sounded a (loud) low battery alarm, waking up the user. I realised that this functionality could have been turned off, and this should be done in the future. Closing apps: The process used to close apps was unreliable, and should be refined (perhaps by closing apps one at a time, rather than attempting to close them all using the \u0026lsquo;Close All\u0026rsquo; button. ECG signal quality: ECG signal quality may have degraded over the course of the study, so it would be helpful to investigate how often electrodes should be changed (and also whether the presence of mains devices affects ECG signal quality).  Remaining questions  ECG chest-patch battery life: Although the device was removed early due to a low battery alarm, it is not clear whether the device could have continued recording for the remaining 0.5 days. When it was connected to a computer the device had approximately 35% battery remaining, indicated that perhaps it could last 7 days. The file size for the ECG signal was 140 MB (leaving over 3GB spare) indicating that the internal storage may be sufficient to store additional signals such as accelerometry, although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear whether turning on the accelerometry would reduce battery life. Chest-patch connector: The chest-patch connector had three electrode connections, but only two were used in this testing. It would be good to find out whether a connector with only two connections is available, which would avoid having a spare connector hanging loosely.  Next Steps Having identified suitable devices for the SAFER Wearables Study, the next steps are:\n To purchase the necessary devices to start the study To amend the participant-facing documentation to include pictures and detailed instructions on how to use the devices (and submit this for ethical approval). To make the automated data acquisition process (streaming data from wristbands to the mobile phone) as robust as possible. To investigate whether the additional functionality of the ECG chest-patch could be used whilst still having enough battery life.

Approximately one in ten people aged over 70 have AF. If AF is recognised then the risk of stroke can be reduced by taking tablets regularly. AF can be difficult to recognise as it can occur without symptoms and only intermittently. Consequently, AF is not recognised in many people, meaning they live with an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, it is important to find ways to identify AF more reliably.\nRecently, wearable devices have been developed which could be useful for identifying AF. Several devices can monitor heart activity in daily life, including wristbands, smart watches and chest patch monitors. The aim of this study is to assess the acceptability and performance of wearables for use in AF screening in older adults.\nAim The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of measuring inter-beat-intervals using a wristband.\nThe secondary objectives are:\n To determine the acceptability of wearables, To determine the acceptability of the screening approach, To assess the performance of wearables for acquiring signals, To assess the performance of signal processing algorithms, To assess the performance of wearables for AF screening.  Who can participate? Selected people who have previously participated in the SAFER Programme can participate in this study. The Investigators (at the University of Cambridge) will invite previous SAFER Programme participants to also participate in this study, aiming to enrol 65 without AF, and 65 with AF.\nWhat does the study involve? Participants will be asked to wear three devices for seven days: Two wristbands (like watches), and one chest patch (like a plaster). These devices will collect measurements of their heart\u0026rsquo;s activity. The Investigators will also ask participants to tell them how they found wearing the devices by completing a questionnaire. The Investigators will compare how participants found wearing each device, and how accurately each device identifies AF.\nFurther Information Further information on the study can be found here.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c7a4bafcb42cb60d2f90df4cb3c60581","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project/safer-wearables/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/safer-wearables/","section":"project","summary":"A study of the acceptability and performance of wearables for atrial fibrillation screening in older adults","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography","atrial fibrillation","SAFER Wearables Study"],"title":"SAFER Wearables Study","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton","Timothy Bonnici","Lionel Tarassenko","David Clifton","Richard Beale","Peter Watkinson","Jordi Alastruey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606694400,"objectID":"0ed6ac3229236ee39c091659f30af79d","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/imp_sqi/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/imp_sqi/","section":"publication","summary":"Design and assessment of a signal quality index for the impedance pneumography signal, and demonstration of its utility for respiratory rate monitoring.","tags":["impedance pneumography"],"title":"An impedance pneumography signal quality index: Design, assessment and application to respiratory rate monitoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton","Panicos Kyriacou","Jonathan Mant","Jordi Alastruey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605312000,"objectID":"9508e9012d013d4b94d43281131c5def","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/ppg_diary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ppg_diary/","section":"publication","summary":"A pilot study investigating the feasibility of acquiring photoplethysmogram (PPG) data during daily life.","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography"],"title":"Acquiring wearable photoplethysmography data in daily life: The PPG Diary Pilot Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Madhumitha Pandiaraja","James Brimicombe","Martin Cowie","Andrew Dymond","Hannah Clair Linden","Gregory Y H Lip","Jonathan Mant","Kate Williams","Peter Charlton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605312000,"objectID":"dcbe85102b9f465892df6d088633efa3","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/reviewing_ecgs/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reviewing_ecgs/","section":"publication","summary":"An investigation into approaches for reducing the workload associated with reviewing ECGs in atrial fibrillation screening.","tags":["atrial fibrillation","electrocardiogram"],"title":"Screening for atrial fibrillation: Improving efficiency of manual review of handheld electrocardiograms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton"],"categories":["Respiratory rate"],"content":"When looking for articles on a particular subject, search engines can quickly produce a wealth of information at our fingertips: 15,400 results in just 0.1 seconds in the search below. In this post I explore the challenge of using search engines to find as much useful literature as possible, whilst not spending all day (or in this case, several months) doing it!\n  A quick search reveals thousands and thousands and thousands of results.  During my PhD I spent many a happy hour looking through the literature on algorithms to estimate respiratory rate from two signals often measured by wearables: the photoplethysmogram and the electrocardiogram. I wanted to find the best algorithm out there, which I assumed meant trawling through every last bit of literature until I found it. In 2017 we published a systematic review of these algorithms, and two of the lessons I learnt stick with me:\n Not all search engines are created equal One search engine just isn\u0026rsquo;t enough (but how many are?) You need lots of search terms (but if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful you\u0026rsquo;ll get lots of junk)  In the rest of this post I provide insights into these two dilemmas, drawing on the results from our systematic review.\nNot all search engines are created equal In our review we used five search engines, and our own manual searching, to find the 196 publications included in the review. The five search engines returned vastly different proportions of the 196 publications that were eventually included:\n  The coverage of the five search engines: the percentage of the publications which were included in the review returned by each search engine.  At one end, Scopus returned 61% of the publications (119 out of the 196 included publications). At the other end, Science Direct returned only 10%.\nTake home message: A single search engine probably won\u0026rsquo;t return all the results of interest.\nYou may also be interested in how much time it takes to download the results from each search engine. In our review we downloaded the results as text files from four of the search engines, and manually copied out the results for one search engine:\n   Search Engine Method used to download results     Google Scholar Copied by hand as no convenient method was available to download results   IEEE Xplore Downloaded as CSV (comma-separated values) file   Pubmed Downloaded as CSV (comma-separated values) file   Science Direct Downloaded as .bib (Bibtex) file   Scopus Downloaded as CSV (comma-separated values) file    Take home message: Some search engines allow you to easily download the results, others don\u0026rsquo;t.\nOnce you have your results, you then need to screen them to identify the relevant publications for inclusion in the review. This can be time-consuming, so ideally you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to screen too many publications for each one finally included. The number of publications we screened per relevant result also varied greatly between search engines:\n  The number of publications which had to be screened to obtain each relevant result, for each search engine.  Take home message: The time taken to screen results varies greatly between search engines.\nIf you must use only one search engine, choose well, as their performance and ease of use differ greatly.\nOne search engine just isn\u0026rsquo;t enough (but how many are?) The most comprehensive results came from Scopus, which found 119 out of the 196 publications, but if we\u0026rsquo;d only used that then we\u0026rsquo;d have missed nearly 40% of the articles we were looking for. So, one search engine just isn\u0026rsquo;t enough \u0026hellip;\nBut how many are? Google Scholar returned a huge 383 potentially relevant results, which were copied down by hand (as they couldn\u0026rsquo;t be exported). In the end, only 14% of these were relevant (it took a while to find that out). At this rate, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t keen to add more search engines in to the mix. I looked back at how many results we would have obtained when using different numbers of search engines:\n  The number of relevant results that we would have obtained, according to how many search engines were used.  So how many search engines are enough? In this search there was some benefit to increasing the number of search engines from one to four, but there was no benefit to using a fifth search engine. You\u0026rsquo;ll note that even all the search engines together returned only 150 out of 196 of the relevant publications included in the review: the remainder were identified manually (through web searching and reading the literature).\nTake home message: It is advisable to use several search engines alongside manual searching.\nYou need lots of search terms (but if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful you\u0026rsquo;ll get lots of junk) In this review we aimed to obtain as many relevant results as possible from search engines, whilst minimising the amount of work required to screen the results. This meant choosing the search terms carefully. To do so we:\n Performed an initial manual search: this identified 90 relevant publications, which were mostly already known to us. Identified key themes from publication titles: we reviewed the titles of these 90 publications to identify three key themes contained within the titles:  the process of respiration (e.g. breathing) a mathematical process (e.g. algorithm) the input signal (e.g. photoplethysmogram)   Identified keywords for each theme: we identified keywords corresponding to each theme which occurred in at least 5% of titles. We found:  3 keywords for \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;the process of respiration\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; 15 keywords for \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;a mathematical process\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; 9 keywords for \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;the input signal\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;   Eliminated keywords which did not add value: we then looked at the proportion of publications which would have been identified had we insisted on the titles containing at least one keyword from each theme (76.7%). We then eliminated 10 keywords which, individually, did not add value to this search. Finalised the search strategy: The final search strategy, which encompassed 75.6% of the 90 manually identified publications was to insist on a publication containing at least one of the following keywords for each theme:     Theme Keywords     respiration breathing, respiration, respiratory   mathematical process derivation, derived, estimation, extraction, methods, rate, rates   input signal ECG, electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, photoplethysmographic, photoplethysmography, PPG, pulse    The end result was that our search identified 642 publications, 31% of which were deemed to be relevant, leading to the 196 publications which were finally included.\nTake home message: Choose keywords carefully to avoid getting too much junk.\nIf you are interested to find out more then you can read the review here.\nAcknowledgment Some of the content for this post was adapted under the CC BY 3.0 Licence from:\nP.

The overall aim of the HotF project is to provide early identification of hospital patients who are deteriorating. Peter\u0026rsquo;s work focuses on using wearable sensors to continuously assess patients' health.\nOne of the key aims of the HotF project is to develop a technique to continuously monitor a patient\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;respiratory rate\u0026rdquo;: how often they breathe. Respiratory rate often changes early in the progression of a deterioration, giving advanced warning of a severe event such as a heart attack. However, it is currently measured by hand by counting the number of times a patient breathes in a set period of time. This approach is time-consuming, inaccurate, and only provides intermittent measurements. The alternative approach which I\u0026rsquo;m working on is to estimate respiratory rate from a small, unobtrusive, wearable sensor.\nWearable sensors are currently routinely used to monitor heart rate and blood oxygenation levels. It turns out that the signals which provide these measurements are subtly influenced by respiration, as demonstrated below. If these subtle changes can be extracted reliably, then we could monitor respiratory rate \u0026ldquo;for free\u0026rdquo;, without the need for any additional sensors. This may provide all-important information on changes in a patient\u0026rsquo;s health, allowing clinicians to identify deteriorating patients earlier.\n  The heart rate is clearly visible in this signal since each spike corresponds to a heart beat. The spikes also vary in height with each of the four breaths. These subtle changes can be used to estimate respiratory rate.  So what\u0026rsquo;s all this got to do with reproducible research? Well, over the past few decades over 100 papers have been written describing methods for estimating respiratory rate electronically from signals that are already monitored by wearable sensors. If you read them (it takes a long time) then you find that hundreds of methods have been described. The key questions are: which method is the best, and is it good enough to use in clinical practice? Answering these questions can be a daunting task given how many different methods there are. Very few of the methods are publicly available, so to answer these questions you\u0026rsquo;d have to implement each of the methods yourself. Even once you have done this, you\u0026rsquo;d need to try them out on some data. Collecting this data is no easy task. Altogether, reproducing scientist\u0026rsquo;s previous work on this problem is quite difficult.\nI\u0026rsquo;m hoping that this won\u0026rsquo;t be such a problem in the future. We have recently implemented many of the methods, collected a benchmark dataset on which to test the methods, and reported the results. All of this is publicly available. What\u0026rsquo;s more, you can download it all for free, from the methods, to the data, to the article describing the results. So in a few clicks you can catch up, reproduce our research, and start making progress yourself, even producing methods like this:\n  Estimating respiratory rate from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals: A surrogate respiratory signal can be extracted from each of the ECG and PPG signals, which looks similar to a reference respiratory signal (Resp), shown above.  Well, nearly \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve written a tutorial on the methods, which is due to be published in a textbook soon. This work can be reproduced exactly. Since then we have extended the range of publicly available resources by adding more methods, and the new benchmark dataset. This most recent work can\u0026rsquo;t be reproduced exactly since we had to make a few changes before making it publicly available. I intend to make future work on this topic fully reproducible so that researchers can build on our work. Who knows, perhaps this will contribute towards earlier identification of deteriorating patients in the future.\nAcknowledgment Originally published here.\n","date":1462924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628985600,"objectID":"81bf41f0ba36a4c1076c1bb1460de22a","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/post/reproducible_research/","publishdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reproducible_research/","section":"post","summary":"A short piece on the progress of the RRest project towards making its research entirely reproducible.","tags":["reproducible research","respiratory rate","wearables"],"title":"Making reproducible research as natural as breathing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton","Timothy Bonnici","Lionel Tarassenko","David Clifton","Richard Beale","Peter Watkinson"],"categories":null,"content":"Prize Awarded the Martin Black Prize for the best paper published in Physiological Measurement in 2016.\n","date":1459296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459296000,"objectID":"b71e42436a656e518071bdf872e371ff","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/rr_algs_assessment/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rr_algs_assessment/","section":"publication","summary":"An assessment of signal processing algorithms to estimate respiratory rate from signals typically acquired by wearables.","tags":[],"title":"An assessment of algorithms to estimate respiratory rate from the electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]

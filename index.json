It is important that the wearables are able to capture data in everyday life when unmonitored (unsupervised by the researchers - left to their own devices).\nThis post describes initial testing of candidate devices for the study.\nDevices The devices under test, shown at the top of this page, were:\n Reference ECG chest-patch: The Bittium Faros 180 was used with long-term electrodes. It was worn on the sternum, with one electrode placed at the top of the sternum, and the other placed towards the bottom of the sternum (the green, F/LL electrode was not attached). It was set to record a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal at 125 Hz, with no additional recording (such as accelerometry) or analysis (such as RR-interval derivation). Data were stored on the device for retrospective download via USB. Photoplethysmography-based wristband: The Max-Health-Band was used to record photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometry (accel) signals at the wrist. PPG signals were sampled at 25 Hz (green and ambient), and tri-axis accel signals were also sampled at 25 Hz. The data are initially stored on the device, and transmitted via Bluetooth to a mobile phone for long-term storage (due to limited on-device memory). Electrocardiography-based wristband: The Withings Move ECG device was used to acquire 30-second ECG recordings on demand (when the user activated the ECG recording). Mobile phone: A \u0026lsquo;Motorola Moto G8 Power Lite\u0026rsquo; Android mobile phone was used to store signals from the two wristbands. Macrodroid was used to open and close two apps in turn to download signals from the PPG and ECG wristbands (the \u0026lsquo;PulseOn Demo\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Withings Health Mate\u0026rsquo; apps respectively). The PPG app was opened twice per hour, for 14 minutes each time, and the ECG app was opened once per hour, for 14 minutes.  Protocol A single user attempted to wear the devices for seven days.\n Reference ECG chest-patch: The user changed electrodes if necessary (due to discomfort), but otherwise the device was unattended. The user shaved prior to application, and removed the device for showering. Photoplethysmography-based wristband: This device was removed and charged each day (typically for 1-2 hours, until it indicated it was fully charged). It was also removed when showering and washing. The device appeared to freeze at one point, so was reset. Otherwise, it was unattended. Electrocardiography-based wristband: ECG recordings were acquired each day (somewhat sporadically). Mobile phone: The mobile phone was kept on charge in a room where the user spent several hours each day.  Outcomes User acceptability The devices were worn for approximately 6.5 days. They were removed early because the ECG chest-patch was sounding a low battery alarm. The user changed electrodes twice during the study.\nData acquisition Learning points We learnt several things from the testing:\n Low battery alarm: The ECG chest-patch sounded a (loud) low battery alarm, waking up the user. I realised that this functionality could have been turned off, and this should be done in the future. Closing apps: The process used to close apps was unreliable, and should be refined (perhaps by closing apps one at a time, rather than attempting to close them all using the \u0026lsquo;Close All\u0026rsquo; button.  Remaining questions  ECG chest-patch battery life: Although the device was removed early due to a low battery alarm, it is not clear whether the device could have continued recording for the remaining 0.5 days. When it was connected to a computer the device had approximately 35% battery remaining, indicated that perhaps it could last 7 days. The file size for the ECG signal was 140 MB (leaving over 3GB spare) indicating that the internal storage may be sufficient to store additional signals such as accelerometry, although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear whether turning on the accelerometry would reduce battery life. Chest-patch connector: The chest-patch connector had three electrode connections, but only two were used in this testing. It would be good to find out whether a connector with only two connections is available, which would avoid having a spare connector hanging loosely.  Next Steps Having identified suitable devices for the SAFER Wearables Study, the next steps are:\n To purchase the necessary devices to start the study To amend the participant-facing documentation to include pictures and detailed instructions on how to use the devices (and submit this for ethical approval). To make the automated data acquisition process (streaming data from wristbands to the mobile phone) as robust as possible. To investigate whether the additional functionality of the ECG chest-patch could be used whilst still having enough battery life.

Approximately one in ten people aged over 70 have AF. If AF is recognised then the risk of stroke can be reduced by taking tablets regularly. AF can be difficult to recognise as it can occur without symptoms and only intermittently. Consequently, AF is not recognised in many people, meaning they live with an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, it is important to find ways to identify AF more reliably.\nRecently, wearable devices have been developed which could be useful for identifying AF. Several devices can monitor heart activity in daily life, including wristbands, smart watches and chest patch monitors. The aim of this study is to assess the acceptability and performance of wearables for use in AF screening in older adults.\nAim The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of measuring inter-beat-intervals using a wristband.\nThe secondary objectives are:\n To determine the acceptability of wearables, To determine the acceptability of the screening approach, To assess the performance of wearables for acquiring signals, To assess the performance of signal processing algorithms, To assess the performance of wearables for AF screening.  Who can participate? Selected people who have previously participated in the SAFER Programme can participate in this study. The Investigators (at the University of Cambridge) will invite previous SAFER Programme participants to also participate in this study, aiming to enrol 65 without AF, and 65 with AF.\nWhat does the study involve? Participants will be asked to wear three devices for seven days: Two wristbands (like watches), and one chest patch (like a plaster). These devices will collect measurements of their heart\u0026rsquo;s activity. The Investigators will also ask participants to tell them how they found wearing the devices by completing a questionnaire. The Investigators will compare how participants found wearing each device, and how accurately each device identifies AF.\nFurther Information Further information on the study can be found here.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c7a4bafcb42cb60d2f90df4cb3c60581","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project/safer-wearables/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/safer-wearables/","section":"project","summary":"A study of the acceptability and performance of wearables for atrial fibrillation screening in older adults","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography","atrial fibrillation","SAFER Wearables Study"],"title":"SAFER Wearables Study","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton","Panicos Kyriacou","Jonathan Mant","Jordi Alastruey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605312000,"objectID":"9508e9012d013d4b94d43281131c5def","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/ppg_diary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ppg_diary/","section":"publication","summary":"A pilot study investigating the feasibility of acquiring photoplethysmogram (PPG) data during daily life.","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography"],"title":"Acquiring wearable photoplethysmography data in daily life: The PPG Diary Pilot Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

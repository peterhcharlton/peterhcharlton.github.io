Approximately one in ten people aged over 70 have AF. If AF is recognised then the risk of stroke can be reduced by taking tablets regularly. AF can be difficult to recognise as it can occur without symptoms and only intermittently. Consequently, AF is not recognised in many people, meaning they live with an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, it is important to find ways to identify AF more reliably.\nRecently, wearable devices have been developed which could be useful for identifying AF. Several devices can monitor heart activity in daily life, including wristbands, smart watches and chest patch monitors. The aim of this study is to assess the acceptability and performance of wearables for use in AF screening in older adults.\nAim The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of measuring inter-beat-intervals using a wristband.\nThe secondary objectives are:\n To determine the acceptability of wearables, To determine the acceptability of the screening approach, To assess the performance of wearables for acquiring signals, To assess the performance of signal processing algorithms, To assess the performance of wearables for AF screening.  Who can participate? Selected people who have previously participated in the SAFER Programme can participate in this study. The Investigators (at the University of Cambridge) will invite previous SAFER Programme participants to also participate in this study, aiming to enrol 65 without AF, and 65 with AF.\nWhat does the study involve? Participants will be asked to wear three devices for seven days: Two wristbands (like watches), and one chest patch (like a plaster). These devices will collect measurements of their heart\u0026rsquo;s activity. The Investigators will also ask participants to tell them how they found wearing the devices by completing a questionnaire. The Investigators will compare how participants found wearing each device, and how accurately each device identifies AF.\nFurther Information Further information on the study can be found here.\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c7a4bafcb42cb60d2f90df4cb3c60581","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project/safer-wearables/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/safer-wearables/","section":"project","summary":"A study of the acceptability and performance of wearables for atrial fibrillation screening in older adults","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography","atrial fibrillation","SAFER Wearables Study"],"title":"SAFER Wearables Study","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Charlton","Panicos Kyriacou","Jonathan Mant","Jordi Alastruey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605312000,"objectID":"9508e9012d013d4b94d43281131c5def","permalink":"https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/ppg_diary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ppg_diary/","section":"publication","summary":"A pilot study investigating the feasibility of acquiring photoplethysmogram (PPG) data during daily life.","tags":["wearables","photoplethysmography"],"title":"Acquiring wearable photoplethysmography data in daily life: The PPG Diary Pilot Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

	    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	    <p>   
		Peter Charlton specialises in the development of signal processing techniques to measure physiological parameters. He gained the degrees of M.Eng. in Engineering Science in 2010 from the University of Oxford, and PhD. in Bioinformatics in 2017 from King's College London. He is now a researcher at King’s College London, working in collaboration with clinicians at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		For several years Peter investigated the utility of wearable sensors to detect clinical deteriorations. He worked jointly with Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust to develop techniques to estimate respiratory rate from physiological signals which are routinely measured by wearable sensors. For his Ph.D. he assessed their performance, and developed a novel technique specifically for use in the ambulatory environment. He then used this technique in a National Clinical Trial to continuously assess the likelihood of deteriorations in acutely-ill patients.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Peter’s present research focuses on non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness, a predictor of cardiovascular events. He is assessing and developing techniques for use in community and hospital settings. These techniques will provide early warning of increased arterial stiffness, and could be used to prompt clinical interventions and potentially reduce the likelihood of major events such as heart failure or stroke.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Peter also contributes towards undergraduate education. He has a keen interest in making research and teaching materials publicly available, and ensures that where possible the datasets and code he uses are made available for future use.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
      The research I am involved in focuses on physiological monitoring of hospital patients, divided into three areas:
      
      <ul>
      <li><b>Development of signal processing techniques for estimation of clinical parameters</b>:
      I have focused on unobtrusive estimation of respiratory rate for use in ambulatory settings, invasive estimation of cardiac output for use in critical care, and novel techniques for analysis of pulsatile cardiovascular signals.

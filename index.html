	    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	    <p>    
	    Peter Charlton gained the degree of MEng in Engineering Science in 2010 from the University of Oxford, with First Class Honours. Following his degree he was appointed as a researcher at King’s College London and the Critical Care Department at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Between 2010 and 2014 his research focused on detection of clinical deterioration using wearable sensors. In collaboration with clinicians and engineers at the University of Oxford, he developed and assessed the performance of algorithms to estimate respiratory rate from signals routinely acquired by wearable sensors. During this time he was an investigator on two national clinical trials. He also conducted research into other areas of physiological measurement, including cardiac output monitoring, developing techniques to analyse pulsatile signals, and developing physiological monitoring equipment for use in clinical settings.
		    
Peter gained the degree of Ph.D in Bioinformatics in 2017 from King’s College London. His thesis, titled “Continuous respiratory rate monitoring to detect clinical deteriorations using wearable sensors”, presented an analysis of the utility of wearable sensors for detecting deteriorations, when used with algorithms to unobtrusively measure RR from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram signals.
		    
Peter’s current research focuses on techniques for assessment of arterial stiffness. He is investigating the performance of arterial stiffness indices which can be obtained through peripheral pulse wave analysis using both computational modelling of the arterial system and clinical data.

		   
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
      The research I am involved in focuses on physiological monitoring of hospital patients, divided into three areas:
      
      <ul>
      <li><b>Development of signal processing techniques for estimation of clinical parameters</b>:
      I have focused on unobtrusive estimation of respiratory rate for use in ambulatory settings, invasive estimation of cardiac output for use in critical care, and novel techniques for analysis of pulsatile cardiovascular signals.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-slide&#34;&gt;Title Slide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic for today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential strategies to improve the efficiency of AF screening, using data from the SAFER Programme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clinical-problem-undiagnosed-af&#34;&gt;Clinical Problem: undiagnosed AF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] If atrial fibrillation was adequately treated in England, then it&amp;rsquo;s estimated that this could save [click] 2,000 lives per year, [click] prevent 7,000 strokes, and result in an additional 425,000 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-solution-af-screening&#34;&gt;Potential Solution: AF screening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that undiagnosed AF could be identified through screening. However, &amp;ldquo;it is unclear whether there is a benefit of formal screening programmes for AF over and above diagnosis of AF only through routine clinical practice&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://view-health-screening-recommendations.service.gov.uk/atrial-fibrillation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UK National Screening Committee, 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. The ongoing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Trial&lt;/a&gt; [click] aims to address this gap in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-introduction&#34;&gt;Personal Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work I&amp;rsquo;m presenting today consists of secondary analysis of data collected in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Programme&lt;/a&gt;. The Trial is being conducted at the University of Cambridge, recruiting patients from East Anglia (in green), and across England (in blue). Many of the analyses involve [click] ECG signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll look at three key questions and potential answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is screening for AF effective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, an introduction to the SAFER Programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-safer-programme&#34;&gt;The SAFER Programme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAFER Programme of research aims to determine [click] whether screening for AF is effective and cost-effective in reducing stroke and other key outcomes compared to current practice. It consists of [click] four parts [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/about-screenforaf/aims-and-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Website&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility study 1:&lt;/strong&gt; A study in 10 GP Practices, including a face-to-face appointment, which 2,141 participants took part in. This has finished, confirming that it is feasible to deliver an AF screening programme in general practice, and that high numbers of patients accept an offer of AF screening and go on to complete the screening process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility study 2:&lt;/strong&gt; When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it became clear that screening could not be delivered in the practice. An additional feasibility study was conducted with participants from 3 GP Practices, in which the screening was delivered remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal pilot study:&lt;/strong&gt; The first phase of the trial is now underway. An internal pilot study is being conducted in 36 practices, consisting of 12 intervention practices where patients will be offered screening, and 24 control practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster randomised controlled trial:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the pilot, we expect to move straight into the remainder of the trial, including a further 324 practices. The whole trial, including the internal pilot, will enrol approximately 126,000 patients from 360 practices, a third of whom will be offered screening. They will be followed up for an average of 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-screening-process&#34;&gt;The Screening Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three main steps of the screening process which I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to are as follows [click]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECGs recorded at home:&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly, participants are sent a handheld device which takes 30-second ECG recordings between two thumbs. Participants are asked to record an ECG 4 times per day, for 3 weeks [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/for-patients/screening-process/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Website&lt;/a&gt;], producing approximately 84 ECGs per participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Secondly, the ECG recordings are automatically analysed to identify any that may contain AF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical review:&lt;/strong&gt; Thirdly, those ECGs which may contain AF are sent for clinical review to make a final diagnosis. Any participants diagnosed with AF then discuss possible anticoagulation with their GP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-screening-for-af-effective&#34;&gt;Is screening for AF effective?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-screening-for-af-effective-and-cost-effective-in-reducing-stroke-and-other-key-outcomes-compared-to-current-practice&#34;&gt;Is screening for AF effective and cost effective in reducing stroke and other key outcomes compared to current practice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been answered in the ongoing SAFER Trial. However, results were recently published for the STROKESTOP trial, a trial using the same handheld devices in Sweden [&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736%2821%2901637-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. There was a &amp;ldquo;small net benefit&amp;rdquo; to screening, as shown by the significantly lower number of events in those invited to screening, compared to the control group. Although there were some differences in trial design, the trial does provide some useful learning points for SAFER, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For screening to be effective, a high proportion of those invited to screening have to participate, since the endpoint was calculated using the intention-to-treat analysis, as is the case in SAFER. In STROKESTOP, of those invited to screening, 51.3% participated. Indeed, those who &amp;ldquo;declined the invitation for screening &amp;hellip; had higher &amp;hellip; stroke risk&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;10.1016/s0140-6736%2821%2901750-5&#34;&gt;Lowres &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. Qualitative researchers in the SAFER team are collecting feedback from non-participants to understand why people decline the invitation to screening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[click] The results also show promise for the choice of combined ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke as the primary endpoint in SAFER. Both of these endpoints showed a signal towards a difference, although this was not significant difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-todays-screening-be-optimised-outline&#34;&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised? (outline)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the second question: How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised? My colleagues and I have been working on optimising the acquisition of ECGs, and their automated review. I&amp;rsquo;ll present preliminary analyses on these two aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecgs-recorded-at-home&#34;&gt;ECGs recorded at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, [click] we are establishing criteria to prompt a telephone call from the research team to participants to provide additional training when required on taking ECGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] Many of the ECGs collected in SAFER are of high quality, such as this ECG here. However, [click] some ECGs are of low quality. These are often difficult, if not impossible, to interpret. Consequently, if a participant records too many low quality ECGs then it may not be possible to accurately identify AF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] In a retrospective analysis of data from the first SAFER Feasibility Study, we investigated the performance of different criteria for identifying participants who would record a high proportion of low quality ECGs. The analysis was performed on 1,486 participants, who each recorded at least 56 ECGs. The criteria were applied to ECGs received during the first 10 days (i.e. the first half) of screening. We aimed for a high sensitivity to participants with less than 75% high quality ECGs, and a low alert rate to minimise the workload associated with the additional calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] Here are the results for three candidate criteria. For each criterion, a threshold was learnt from the data. The third criterion, which consisted of triggering a call if more than 25% of a participant&amp;rsquo;s ECGs were of low quality, resulted in a high sensitivity at the desired alert rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;effectiveness-of-criterion-to-prompt-a-training-call&#34;&gt;Effectiveness of criterion to prompt a training call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] The effectiveness of this criterion was then assessed when it was used in the second SAFER Feasibility Study. This study was smaller, with &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; participants. &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; of these participants received a telephone call - reassuringly, this indicates an alert rate of approximately 4% as desired. It&amp;rsquo;s testament to the SAFER Team that these calls resulted in a reduction in the percentage of low quality recordings, as shown in this box plot. &lt;em&gt;(describe reduction shown in plot)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have found that training calls can be targeted to those participants who would benefit most from them, and that they are effective in improving the quality of ECG recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;automated-analysis&#34;&gt;Automated analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second analysis which informed the Trial&amp;rsquo;s methodology was an assessment of the performance of algorithm tags for identifying AF, and the workload associated with reviewing ECGs classified with each tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly summarise how the algorithm works. [Click] Each ECG is analysed by [click] detecting heartbeats, [click] analysing the heart rhythm, and assessing [click] whether P-waves are present or not. A key question [click] is: which tags should be used to identify ECGs for review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[click] In a retrospective analysis, I assessed the sensitivity of each tag to AF, and its positive predictive value. This was performed using manual annotations of 911 ECGs containing AF provided by cardiologists. Six tags showed reasonable performance (shown in bold). These were considered as candidates to identify ECGs for clinical review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[click] In a second analysis, I investigated the workload and effectiveness of the combination of tags used in this Feasibility Study, and all possible combinations of the candidate tags. The combination of tags used in the study, shown in the first row, was particularly comprehensive, and resulted in 23,000 ECGs being sent for review. Through this process 54 participants were diagnosed with AF. The remaining rows show selected combinations using subsets of these tags. As the number of tags is reduced, the number of ECGs sent for review is reduced. Only in the last combination, the irregular sequence tag on its own, was there an impact on the diagnosis of AF, with one participant being missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I recommended that the irregular sequence and fast regular tags be used in SAFER, which in this analysis would have substantially reduced the workload associated with ECG reviewing, whilst maintaining the number of AF diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-ecgs-for-review&#34;&gt;Ordering ECGs for review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a participant&amp;rsquo;s ECGs are presented for clinical review, they are currently ordered chronologically. We&amp;rsquo;re interested in whether they could be ordered according to the probability of an AF diagnosis being made. This could improve the efficiency of the review process, as once an ECG exhibiting AF is found, no further ECGs are reviewed for that participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a preliminary investigation by developing a logistic regression model to estimate the probability that an ECG will be diagnosed with AF. It took as inputs: the heart rate, standard deviation of RR-intervals, and classifications provided by the Cardiolund algorithm being used in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] We found that the number of cardiologist reviews that would have been required in the first two feasibility studies could theoretically have been reduced by approximately a quarter by using this model to order ECGs, whilst still identifying all cases of AF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] We also found that only sending ECGs for review which had at least a threshold probability of AF, reduced the number of reviews further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inter-reviewer-agreement&#34;&gt;Inter-reviewer agreement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-todays-screening-be-optimised&#34;&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;ve presented preliminary results on questions relating to optimising the current approach to screening, specifically on: training calls, automated analysis of ECGs, and the review process. In addition, I am particularly interested in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we develop a library of ECGs with which to train new reviewers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How best to evaluate the probability that an ECG: (i) exhibits AF; and (ii) is of diagnostic quality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-might-tomorrows-screening-look-like-outline&#34;&gt;What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like? (outline)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the third question: What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like? As an engineer, it is my hope that the data collected in both the SAFER Programme and follow-on studies will be useful for informing tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s approach to screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;could-consumer-devices-be-used-for-clinical-decision-making&#34;&gt;Could consumer devices be used for clinical decision making?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question going forward will be: Could consumer devices be used for clinical decision making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices like those shown here are commercially available, including the AliveCor device (left), which allows users to record their ECG with a small add-on to their smartphone. Watches by Withings [click], such as that shown here, also allow users to record a 30-second ECG. And, fitness trackers and smartwatches which measure the arterial pulse wave are now commonplace [click], some of which can identify an irregular pulse which may be indicative of AF. We are starting the SAFER Wearables study, a study to assess the acceptability and performance of wearables such as those shown here for identifying AF in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this would have been possible without:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The NIHR and BHF, who funded the work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence is emerging showing the clinical benefit of AF screening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trials are ongoing, which will also assess the cost-effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wearables are used to identify AF, they should be like a harness: highly reliable (effective), and good value (cost-effective).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcript accompanies &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/talk/the-beauty-of-biomedical-engineering/&#34;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the transcript content is reproduced from Peter Charlton&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/cont_resp_monitoring/&#34;&gt;PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-spoken-content&#34;&gt;Initial spoken content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On receiving &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/post/ipem_early_career_award/&#34;&gt;this prize&lt;/a&gt;, it might seem appropriate to give a whistle-stop tour of the engineering projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in. My apologies to anyone expecting this, if you&amp;rsquo;re really interested you can read all about our work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m going to share a few thoughts on why Biomedical Engineering is a fantastic field to work in. So, the beauty of Biomedical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-colleagues&#34;&gt;The colleagues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the colleagues. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to work with great colleagues, who have been an inspiration to me throughout my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly struck by one encounter early in my career. One morning, probably around 10am, a few of us were meeting to discuss a new approach to a problem. An intensive care consultant arrived dressed in scrubs and clutching a cup of coffee. It transpired that he had been on call the previous day, had been up most of the night, and here he was having just handed over, ready to engage in the mathematics of a new signal processing technique, which in the very distant future could potentially help identify the early signs of sepsis. I was inspired by this colleague&amp;rsquo;s dedication, which encourages me to work hard on clinical problems to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long later, I was in the same room being introduced to an engineer who had developed a health-monitoring system for jet engines, providing real-time information to ensure the safe passage of air passengers. Now he had turned his attention to a health-monitoring system for people, aiming to spot clinical deteriorations from subtle changes in vital signs. I was inspired by his skill, translating complex analytical techniques across fields, for the benefit of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I was at a conference in a mega venue in Brussels, which seemed better suited to debating Members of Parliament than researchers with poster tubes tucked under their arms. One talk described a research study conducted across multiple countries, which had investigated the use of fluid resuscitation to treat children with shock. Whereas this intervention was used everyday in adult intensive care to save lives, the study found it increased mortality in this population - a finding that had apparently baffled the intensive care world. Later that day I attended another session in what felt like a debating chamber, each seat equipped with its own microphone. The chair had asked everyone to speak into their microphones when asking questions. Both the chair and audience quickly became frustrated when one attendee was unable to find the large orange button directly in front of them, with which to turn on their microphone. It was the researcher who&amp;rsquo;d managed to conduct the baffling study in children across several countries, who finally pointed out that this attendee simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t see their microphone button because their laptop was covering it. I was inspired by her &amp;lsquo;smartness&amp;rsquo;, shown by her ability to conduct excellent research, and to solve simple problems which left the rest of us frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - the first reason Biomedical Engineering is fantastic - the colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-patients&#34;&gt;The patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the patients. Many, many patients have contributed their time and effort to the research studies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. Several years ago I helped run a study investigating the use of wearables for monitoring hospital patients. Initially, we expected to equip patients with a miniature gadget, perhaps in the form of a lapel badge, which would transmit their vital signs in real-time to an all-knowing computer, which would quickly identify any problems as they developed. It turned out, in the early 2010s, that such gadgets didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Instead, we used the existing telemetry devices to monitor patients. These were large devices, about the size of a bag of sugar, that you either had to carry round in your hand, or wear in a shoulder bag slung across your chest. Needless to say, there was a mixed reaction, demonstrated by three patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One patient tolerated the sensor poorly, until it detected that they were having a cardiac arrest and arguably saved their life. Thereafter they tolerated the sensor very well indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One patient was very talkative before their operation, and despite wearing the sensor, died tragically young a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one patient, who probably didn&amp;rsquo;t need a sensor, ended up practically dancing around the ward whilst wearing it. I can still see them stood at the nurses station, laughing and joking with the staff on the ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - the second reason Biomedical Engineering is fantastic - the patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-engineering-problems&#34;&gt;The Engineering Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the engineering problems. Biomedical engineering problems have all the hallmarks of an exciting engineering project: a problem which we don&amp;rsquo;t understand well, a plethora of innovative solutions, and the potential to save lives. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a very brief example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slide-respiratory-rate&#34;&gt;Slide: Respiratory Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory rate (RR), the number of breaths taken in a minute, is used in a range of clinical settings for diagnosis and prognosis. [click] Normal RRs lie between 12 and 20 breaths per minute. [click] Elevated RRs have been found to be associated with: [click] COVID-19 diagnosis; [click] admission to intensive care with COVID-19 [click]; and death in hospital with COVID-19. Consequently, it may be helpful to monitor RR to tackle COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slide-wearables-for-monitoring-respiratory-rate&#34;&gt;Slide: Wearables for monitoring Respiratory Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearables provide a potential opportunity to monitor RR unobtrusively in daily life. [click] Many wearables monitor the pulse at the wrist by measuring an optical signal, the photoplethysmogram (or PPG for short). [click] This signal exhibits a pulse wave for each heart beat, [click] and is also subtly influenced by breathing. Consequently, much research has been conducted on estimating RR from this signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slide-errors-are-not-normally-distributed&#34;&gt;Slide: Errors are not normally distributed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when taking measurements, such as measuring time or length, one might expect measurement errors to be normally distributed. However, when developing algorithms to estimate RR from wearable sensors, I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck that the errors are not necessarily normally distributed. For instance, these plots show the reference RR on the x-axis, and the RR provided by an algorithm on the y-axis. I&amp;rsquo;ve repeated the experiment on three different datasets, providing the three plots. Most of the points are clustered around the line of identity, as expected if errors are normally distributed. However, [click] some measurements are very inaccurate, providing erroneously low RRs, which could potentially trigger erroneous clinical responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] In this second algorithm, the errors are more normally distributed without the highly erroneous outliers. However, the errors tend to be greater. So we have two algorithms with differing performance characteristics. For this particular problem, it turns out that by combining the two algorithms, one can improve performance, using the upper algorithm to avoid large errors, and the second algorithm to minimise errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-slide&#34;&gt;Closing Slide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently refining the algorithms [click] for use in daily life, and it is my hope that this work will be of great benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this particular problem, you can read more about it and our other work at this website [click]. So - the third reason Biomedical Engineering is fantastic - the challenging problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude, I think Biomedical Engineering [click] is a fantastic field to work in because of the inspirational colleagues, generous patients, and intriguing engineering challenges. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank [click] my funders, and thank IPEM for this prize and the continued support throughout my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transcript accompanies &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/talk/screening-for-af-questions-and-potential-answers/&#34;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;title-slide&#34;&gt;Title Slide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic for today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screening for atrial fibrillation: questions and potential answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clinical-problem-undiagnosed-af&#34;&gt;Clinical Problem: undiagnosed AF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] If atrial fibrillation was adequately treated in England, then it&amp;rsquo;s estimated that this could save [click] 2,000 lives per year, [click] prevent 7,000 strokes, and result in an additional 425,000 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-solution-af-screening&#34;&gt;Potential Solution: AF screening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that undiagnosed AF could be identified through screening. However, &amp;ldquo;it is unclear whether there is a benefit of formal screening programmes for AF over and above diagnosis of AF only through routine clinical practice&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://view-health-screening-recommendations.service.gov.uk/atrial-fibrillation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UK National Screening Committee, 2019&lt;/a&gt;]. The ongoing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Trial&lt;/a&gt; [click] aims to determine whether screening for AF is effective and cost-effective in reducing stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-introduction&#34;&gt;Personal Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce myself [click], my name&amp;rsquo;s Peter Charlton, and I&amp;rsquo;m a researcher in Biomedical Engineering. I develop techniques to analyse physiological signals, such as the ECGs acquired in screening studies, to aid clinical decision making. I initially conducted my research here at St Thomas&#39; Hospital in London, working with clinicians to develop techniques to identify the early signs of clinical deterioration from wearable sensor signals. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been analysing ECG data [click] collected by the SAFER Research Team, at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll look at three key questions and potential answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is screening for AF effective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, an introduction to AF screening and the SAFER Programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;atrial-fibrillation&#34;&gt;Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AF is one of the most common arrhythmias, diagnosed in 3% of UK people over the age of 35 [&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2018-312977&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Adderley &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. It is associated with a fivefold increase in stroke risk [&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/0.1161/01.str.22.8.983&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wolf &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. If AF is recognised then the risk of stroke can be reduced by 60-70% through anticoagulation [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17577005&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hart &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.116.003725&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yao &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. AF is currently diagnosed opportunistically in primary care, and verified by ECG. Whilst some cases of AF are persistent [click], meaning that the patient is in AF all the time, others are paroxysmal [click], meaning there are only intermittent episodes of AF which could be missed in a one-off ECG test. Furthermore, AF can be asymptomatic [click], meaning testing may not be indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-safer-programme&#34;&gt;The SAFER Programme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAFER Programme of research, led by Prof Jonathan Mant, aims to determine [click] whether screening for AF is effective and cost-effective in reducing stroke and other key outcomes compared to current practice. It consists of [click] four parts [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/about-screenforaf/aims-and-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Website&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility study 1:&lt;/strong&gt; A study in 10 GP Practices, including a face-to-face appointment, which 2,141 participants took part in. This has finished, confirming that it is feasible to deliver an AF screening programme in general practice, and that high numbers of patients accept an offer of AF screening and go on to complete the screening process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility study 2:&lt;/strong&gt; When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it became clear that screening could not be delivered in the practice. An additional feasibility study was conducted with participants from 3 GP Practices, in which the screening was delivered remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal pilot study:&lt;/strong&gt; The first phase of the trial is now underway. An internal pilot study is being conducted in 36 practices, consisting of 12 intervention practices where patients will be offered screening, and 24 control practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster randomised controlled trial:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the pilot, we expect to move straight into the remainder of the trial, including a further 324 practices. The whole trial, including the internal pilot, will enrol approximately 126,000 patients from 360 practices, a third of whom will be offered screening. They will be followed up for an average of 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-screening-process&#34;&gt;The Screening Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three main steps of the screening process which I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to are as follows [click]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECGs recorded at home:&lt;/strong&gt; Firstly, participants are sent a handheld device which takes 30-second ECG recordings between two thumbs. Participants are asked to record an ECG 4 times per day, for 3 weeks [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/for-patients/screening-process/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SAFER Website&lt;/a&gt;], producing approximately 84 ECGs per participant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Secondly, the ECG recordings are automatically analysed to identify any that may contain AF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical review:&lt;/strong&gt; Thirdly, those ECGs which may contain AF are sent for clinical review to make a final diagnosis. Any participants diagnosed with AF then discuss possible anticoagulation with their GP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-screening-for-af-effective&#34;&gt;Is screening for AF effective?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-screening-for-af-effective-and-cost-effective-in-reducing-stroke-and-other-key-outcomes-compared-to-current-practice&#34;&gt;Is screening for AF effective and cost effective in reducing stroke and other key outcomes compared to current practice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been answered in the ongoing SAFER Trial. However, results were recently published for the STROKESTOP trial, a trial using the same handheld devices in Sweden [&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736%2821%2901637-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;]. There was a &amp;ldquo;small net benefit&amp;rdquo; to screening, as shown by the significantly lower number of events in those invited to screening, compared to the control group. Although there were some differences in trial design, the trial does provide some useful learning points for SAFER, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For screening to be effective, a high proportion of those invited to screening have to participate, since the endpoint was calculated using the intention-to-treat analysis, as is the case in SAFER. In STROKESTOP, of those invited to screening, 51.3% participated. Indeed, those who &amp;ldquo;declined the invitation for screening &amp;hellip; had higher &amp;hellip; stroke risk&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;10.1016/s0140-6736%2821%2901750-5&#34;&gt;Lowres &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. As noted in the accompanying commentary, &amp;ldquo;A different approach is being adopted in the SAFER study, in which patients in general practices are invited to join the study, and practices are only randomly assigned to screening or control after a sufficient number of patients consent, which should obviate the design problem of dilution by non-participants&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;10.1016/s0140-6736%2821%2901750-5&#34;&gt;Lowres &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]. Qualitative researchers in the SAFER team are collecting feedback from non-participants to understand why people decline the invitation to screening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[click] The results also show promise for the choice of combined ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke as the primary endpoint in SAFER. Both of these endpoints showed a signal towards a difference, although this was not significant difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-todays-screening-be-optimised-outline&#34;&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised? (outline)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the second question: How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised? My colleagues and I have been working on optimising the acquisition of ECGs, and their automated review. I&amp;rsquo;ll present preliminary analyses on these two aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecgs-recorded-at-home&#34;&gt;ECGs recorded at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, [click] we are establishing criteria to prompt a telephone call from the research team to participants to provide additional training when required on taking ECGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] Many of the ECGs collected in SAFER are of high quality, such as this ECG here. However, [click] some ECGs are of low quality. These are often difficult, if not impossible, to interpret. Consequently, if a participant records too many low quality ECGs then it may not be possible to accurately identify AF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] In a retrospective analysis of data from the first SAFER Feasibility Study, we investigated the performance of different criteria for identifying participants who would record a high proportion of low quality ECGs. The analysis was performed on 1,486 participants, who each recorded at least 56 ECGs. The criteria were applied to ECGs received during the first 10 days (i.e. the first half) of screening. We aimed for a high sensitivity to participants with less than 75% high quality ECGs, and a low alert rate to minimise the workload associated with the additional calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] Here are the results for three candidate criteria. For each criterion, a threshold was learnt from the data. The third criterion, which consisted of triggering a call if more than 25% of a participant&amp;rsquo;s ECGs were of low quality, resulted in a high sensitivity at the desired alert rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;effectiveness-of-criterion-to-prompt-a-training-call&#34;&gt;Effectiveness of criterion to prompt a training call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click] The effectiveness of this criterion was then assessed when it was used in the second SAFER Feasibility Study. This study was smaller, with &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; participants. &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; of these participants received a telephone call - reassuringly, this indicates an alert rate of approximately 4% as desired. It&amp;rsquo;s testament to the SAFER Team that these calls resulted in a reduction in the percentage of low quality recordings, as shown in this box plot. &lt;em&gt;(describe reduction shown in plot)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have found that training calls can be targeted to those participants who would benefit most from them, and that they are effective in improving the quality of ECG recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;automated-analysis&#34;&gt;Automated analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second analysis which informed the Trial&amp;rsquo;s methodology was an assessment of the performance of algorithm tags for identifying AF, and the workload associated with reviewing ECGs classified with each tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly summarise how the algorithm works. [Click] Each ECG is analysed by [click] detecting heartbeats, [click] analysing the heart rhythm, and assessing [click] whether P-waves are present or not. A key question [click] is: which tags should be used to identify ECGs for review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[click] In a retrospective analysis, I assessed the sensitivity of each tag to AF, and its positive predictive value. This was performed using manual annotations of 911 ECGs containing AF provided by cardiologists. Six tags showed reasonable performance (shown in bold). These were considered as candidates to identify ECGs for clinical review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[click] In a second analysis, I investigated the workload and effectiveness of the combination of tags used in this Feasibility Study, and all possible combinations of the candidate tags. The combination of tags used in the study, shown in the first row, was particularly comprehensive, and resulted in 23,000 ECGs being sent for review. Through this process 54 participants were diagnosed with AF. The remaining rows show selected combinations using subsets of these tags. As the number of tags is reduced, the number of ECGs sent for review is reduced. Only in the last combination, the irregular sequence tag on its own, was there an impact on the diagnosis of AF, with one participant being missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I recommended that the irregular sequence and fast regular tags be used in SAFER, which in this analysis would have substantially reduced the workload associated with ECG reviewing, whilst maintaining the number of AF diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-todays-screening-be-optimised&#34;&gt;How can today&amp;rsquo;s screening be optimised?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;ve presented preliminary results on questions relating to optimising the current approach to screening, specifically on: training calls, and the automated analysis of ECGs. In addition, I am particularly interested in the following additional questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can ECGs be ordered according to their likelihood of exhibiting AF?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the level of inter-reviewer agreement in diagnoses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many reviewers should review each patient?s data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we develop a library of ECGs with which to train new reviewers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-might-tomorrows-screening-look-like-outline&#34;&gt;What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like? (outline)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the third question: What might tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s screening look like? As an engineer, it is my hope that the data collected in both the SAFER Programme and follow-on studies will be useful for informing tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s approach to screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;could-consumer-devices-be-used-for-clinical-decision-making&#34;&gt;Could consumer devices be used for clinical decision making?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question going forward will be: Could consumer devices be used for clinical decision making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices like those shown here are commercially available, including the AliveCor device (left), which allows users to record their ECG with a small add-on to their smartphone. Watches by Withings [click], such as that shown here, also allow users to record a 30-second ECG. And, fitness trackers and smartwatches which measure the arterial pulse wave are now commonplace [click], some of which can identify an irregular pulse which may be indicative of AF. We are starting the SAFER Wearables study, a study to assess the acceptability and performance of wearables such as those shown here for identifying AF in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-consumer-devices-to-identify-af&#34;&gt;Using consumer devices to identify AF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it has already been shown that smartwatches could potentially be used to unobtrusively check for AF in daily life as follows. In [click] a normal rhythm, [click] the beat-to-beat intervals are fairly consistent. In contrast, [click] in atrial fibrillation the beat-to-beat intervals are irregular [click]. Potentially, a consumer wearable could be used to identify possible AF episodes in this manner. Indeed, the potential utility of an Apple Watch to identify AF was recently assessed in the Apple Heart Study in over 400,000 individuals. Key results included a reassuringly low alert rate [click], a high positive predictive value of alerts [click], and a much longer monitoring time [click] than could be achieved at scale in clinical practice. In this study, possible AF episodes prompted further monitoring using the gold standard of an ECG-based wearable in order to confirm a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAFER Wearables Study will add to this evidence by assessing the performance of the technology in older adults, and daily life - two aspects that in our opinion, require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this would have been possible without:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence is emerging showing the clinical benefit of AF screening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trials are ongoing, which will also assess the cost-effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If wearables are used to identify AF, they should be like a harness: highly reliable, and for a specified purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used modelling in &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/simulating_pulse_waves/&#34;&gt;my research&lt;/a&gt; to simulate pulse waves, to investigate how vascular age can be assessed from arterial pulse waves. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it a useful tool for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding physiological mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;: Investigating what physiological mechanisms cause the changes in pulse waves that occur with age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;: Designing algorithms to assess vascular age, by developing them using data from simulated subjects across a wide range of ages, and a wide range of cardiovascular properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating algorithm performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Investigating which cardiovascular properties can affect algorithm performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a brief overview of how this particular model works, and then demonstrate its utility through case studies. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with some thoughts on the limitations, benefits and opportunities of this type of modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model that I have used in my work is summarised in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-model&#34;&gt;The Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1D model simulates blood flow, starting with flow into the aorta, then through the major arteries, and finally into the microcirculation. It consists of three main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aortic Inflow:&lt;/strong&gt; The flow from the left ventricle into the aorta is specified. It is defined by several parameters, as illustrated in the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arterial Network:&lt;/strong&gt; The larger arteries of the body are specified in the model. The arteries are assumed to be thin, deformable, cylindrical tubes. They have a specified length, luminal diameter, and wall properties (such as arterial stiffness).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vascular Beds:&lt;/strong&gt; The vascular beds are themselves modelled using 0D (Windkessel) models, each with a specified resistance and compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simulated-pulse-waves&#34;&gt;Simulated Pulse Waves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulse waves can be simulated at any of the large arteries, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image shows the different types of waveforms which the model can simulate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure (P)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood flow velocity (U):&lt;/strong&gt; The speed at which blood flows through an artery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luminal area (A):&lt;/strong&gt; The cross-sectional area of an artery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoplethysmogram (PPG):&lt;/strong&gt; An optical measure of blood volume in a vascular bed, commonly measured by pulse oximeters and digital wearable devices (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; smartwatches and fitness trackers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of this type of modelling is that it allows waveforms to be simulated at multiple sites, and, it also captures the pulse transit times between different sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-limitations&#34;&gt;Model Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll Question:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.sli.do/event/1zunclmb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;What are the limitations of the model?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-limitations&#34;&gt;Possible Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;A few thoughts&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic inflow, as opposed to normal heart rate variability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specified arterial properties, which may not be representative of a particular individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not able to model venous flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;input-parameters&#34;&gt;Input Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model requires a plethora of &amp;lsquo;input parameters&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;settings&amp;rsquo;), such as the heart rate, stiffness of each artery, and systemic vascular resistance. Some of these parameters have a marked impact on the simulated pulse waves, whereas others have only a small impact. For instance, the image below shows how the variation of each of the following input parameters impacts the simulated carotid and radial waveforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HR: heart rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SV: stroke volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LVET: left ventricular ejection time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFT: time of peak aortic flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFV: reverse flow volume caused by aortic valve closure at the end of systole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length: the length of the ascending aorta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diam: the diameters of the largest arteries (aorta and carotid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PWV: pulse wave velocities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAP: mean blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PVC: peripheral vascular compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;changing-inputs&#34;&gt;Changing Inputs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Which parameters would be most interesting to change, and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Which parameters are most relevant to vascular ageing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;changing-inputs-3&#34;&gt;Changing Inputs (3)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of input parameters suitable for simulating pulse waves for young adults was proposed by (amongst others) &lt;a href=&#34;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10439-015-1313-8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mynard and Smolich&lt;/a&gt;. We extended this by proposing a range of parameters to simulate pulse waves for healthy subjects aged 25-75, exhibiting a range of cardiovascular properties. Our proposed ranges of parameters are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ranges of parameters are based on a review of those reported in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-set-of-virtual-subjects&#34;&gt;A set of Virtual Subjects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to create a set of virtual subjects representative of a sample of healthy subjects aged 25-75 years old. To do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baseline subject at each age:&lt;/strong&gt; We created a baseline subject for each age (25 to 75, in 10 year intervals), using the mean value of each parameter at that age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varying parameters at each age:&lt;/strong&gt; We then created an additional 728 virtual subjects at each age by varying each parameter by Â±1 SD from the mean, and creating a subject with each possible combination of parameters. Only the six most influential parameters were varied (HR, SV, LVET, Diam, PWV, PVR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database of simulated pulse waves:&lt;/strong&gt; We created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; of simulated pulse waves for 4,374 virtual subjects (consisting of 729 at each of the six age groups). The database and accompanying code are publicly available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparison-with-_in-vivo_-data&#34;&gt;Comparison with &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We verified this approach for simulating pulse waves for subjects of different ages by comparing the simulated pulse waves with &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; pulse waves, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;thoughts-on-performance&#34;&gt;Thoughts on Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;A few thoughts&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Captured increase in amplitude of second systolic peaks with age in carotid, aortic root and radial pressure waveforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Captured disappearance of second peak of finger PPG waveform with age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonetheless, some marked differences between &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and simulated waveforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of the verification of this approach are provided in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/simulating_pulse_waves/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;accompanying article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-wearable-device&#34;&gt;Digital Wearable Device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the limitations of some current techniques for assessing arterial stiffness is that they require specialist equipment and/or specialist operators. A potential alternative is to acquire pulse waves using consumer devices worn in daily life, such as smartwatches or fitness trackers (shown below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many approaches have been proposed to assess arterial stiffness from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, based on the observation that the PPG pulse wave changes shape with age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assessing-arterial-stiffness&#34;&gt;Assessing Arterial Stiffness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for assessing arterial stiffness from the PPG mostly consist of two steps (as shown below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying fiducial points (left)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracting pulse wave features (right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following three indices were extracted from PPG pulse waves in this case study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection Index (RI, illustrated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stiffness Index (SI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modified Aging Index (AGImod)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were calculated for each virtual subject, and then their correlation with the reference aortic PWV was assessed. In addition, we investigated the cardiovascular determinants of each index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall performance across all ages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance within an individual age group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Influence of not only PWV, but other CV properties (note difference in influence of &amp;lsquo;diam&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implications&#34;&gt;Implications:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical studies should investigate performance over a small age range as well as over the entire cohort to assess the potential utility of indexes for stratifying patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexes can also be influenced by HR and SV, indicating that it may be beneficial to assess performance when these CV properties are varied &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What would you think of using this technology to assess vascular age?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might it compare to other technologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could one assess the relative performance of such technologies?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case study, we investigated the determinants of changes in PPamp with age. To do so, we assessed the effects of age on early systolic amplification and late systolic aortic pressure augmentation, calculated using the aortic PP at P1 and P2, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; In A and B: how does the pulse wave change shape with distance from the aortic root to the finger? How does this differ with age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profiles demonstrate that two mechanisms influence PPamp (PPamp / PPb/PPa; subscripts &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;b&amp;rdquo; indicate aortic and brachial, respectively):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early systolic portion was amplified in both subjects, causing SBPb to be greater than SBPa and therefore PPamp &amp;gt; 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late systolic aortic pressure augmentation (the increase in pressure from P1a to P2a) was higher in older subjects, increasing PPa and decreasing PPamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contributions of these mechanisms to PPamp for the whole database are illustrated in panel C. The amplification of the early systolic portion increased with age, as shown in red by PPb/(P1a &amp;gt; DBPa). In contrast, the increase in late systolic aortic pressure augmentation with age (in blue) caused a decrease in PPb/(P2a &amp;gt; DBPa) with age. The effect of aortic pressure augmentation outweighed that of early systolic amplification, meaning PPamp decreased substantially with age, in keeping with in vivo studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early systolic amplification was determined primarily by the diameter of the larger arteries, and late systolic aortic pressure augmentation was largely determined by PWV and LVET, as shown in panels D and E. Indeed, since PPamp was primarily determined by late systolic aortic pressure augmentation, it was largely determined by arterial stiffness (i.e., PWV) and LVET, as shown in panel F. The change in PPamp observed with age was primarily due to changes in aortic pressure wave morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implications-1&#34;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database can be used to gain insight into the CV determinants of mechanisms of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a study in which pulse wave modelling could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would need to be simulated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under what conditions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which ways would the model need to be particularly accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependent on model accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which in turn, is dependent on input parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often requires specialist knowledge to perform studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
